# RecruApp is a mobile app for detecting an outlier number in a set of integers, built with Flutter.

RecruApp is a simple mobile application that allows users to input a list of integers and automatically detect the outlier value — a number that differs in parity (even/odd) from the rest of the dataset.

✨ Key Features

- 🔍 Outlier Detection – Finds the single number that differs in parity from the rest
- 🧠 Smart Validation – Detects missing even/odd numbers and ambiguous input cases
- 🛠 Auto-Fix Mechanism – Automatically corrects invalid input on user request
- ✍️ Input Normalization – Handles extra commas, misplaced minus signs, and malformed input
- ⚠️ User Decisions – Allows users to continue, auto-fix, or manually adjust invalid input
- 📱 Cross-Platform – Runs on both Android and iOS
- 🎨 Modern UI

🧩 How It Works

1. The user enters a list of integers separated by commas
   
Example:
<img width="172" height="44" alt="Zrzut ekranu 2025-12-17 o 03 27 42" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6be73f48-2f29-4679-81ff-b2afcd63327e" />

2. The app:
- normalizes the input (removes extra commas, fixes malformed negatives)
- validates the data
- detects the majority parity
- finds and displays the outlier

3. If the input is ambiguous (e.g. more than one possible outlier), the user can:
- ✔ Auto-fix the input
- ✍️ Fix it manually
- ▶ Continue anyway - The application will return the first number in the array that does not match the others
